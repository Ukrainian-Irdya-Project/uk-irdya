They will, however, defend these to the death; to this end, the forest elves have proven allies of convenience. The elves themselves have long had respect for those with a close affinity with the Arcane Flame. It is due to this close relationship that faeries will sometimes be found by the elves’ side in times of great need.\n"

But humans can only do so much to change the flawed reality in which they dwell, and their chaotic, vicious nature surfaces at every turn. The cultists of Chaos believe that only Uria, Mother of all demons, Goddess of Life and Mistress of the Void, can reshape and improve this decaying world. They dedicate their very souls to doing her bidding and spreading her message to every corner of Irdya.\n"

Their dedication to their craft borders on irrational, and the wars they wage often serve much darker purposes. Those unlucky enough to survive are taken captive, fated to undergo unfathomable horrors in the name of the Lorekeepers’ unending search for knowledge. It is this, more than anything else, that keeps their subjects in line; they are well aware of the consequences should they disobey an order even slightly.\n"

Very little information about it has reached any outsider, but the little extant evidence indicates that it is a common disciplinary action against those who have failed in their missions or otherwise displeased their superiors. They are then given a last chance to clear their names and prove their worth, usually with new bodies seldom fit for the task.\n"
"\n"
"It is suspected that most of the Chaos Hounds who manage to survive their masters’ research have had their souls replaced with those of these fallen demons, either because their original souls break down from the horrors, or simply because it is much easier to strip a tortured soul from its vessel. The denizens of Inferno have found that there could hardly be anything more humiliating than being forced to carry on their lives confined to the bodies of beasts that even their Irdyan allies despise: walking on all fours, sleeping next to their own excrement, and eventually succumbing to their low instincts. Having long since realized that regaining their honor is a lost cause, these miserable creatures determine that there are only two remaining options: either to embrace death at the hands of their enemies, or turn against their masters and pray that they do not decide to prolong the torment."
